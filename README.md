Ansible Playbook to make some adjustments to a Fedora Workstation
====================================================================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eRadical/ansible-my-fedora-workstation.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eRadical/ansible-my-fedora-workstation)

This is my setup. It was created to be of help when re-installing a Fedora Workstation... or keeping it up to date.
By no means this is complete or suitable as is for you.

How to run...
=============

- You should make sure you can `sudo` to `root` without password,
- Clone the repo,
- Change variables from the symlink `customize-me` as you wish,
- Open a terminal in the folder it was cloned,
- Run the script `./configure-fedora`
