By no means this is complete or for you.

This is my setup. It was created to be of help when re-installing a Fedora Workstation.

How to run...
=============

- You should make sure you can `sudo` to `root` without password,
- Clone the repo,
- Open a terminal and go in the folder it was cloned,
- Change variables from inventory/group_vars/all as you wish,
- Run the script `configure-fedora`
